# fakenews_trials
My attempts to make a model that detects fake news as accurately as possible.

Attempt 1: Passive Aggressive Classifier on TF-IDF vectorized data, and increasing its accuracy via modifying its most important parameters.

Attempt 2: SVM with several kernel types on CountVectorized data, with data preprocessed with tokenization, lemmatization, whitespace & punctuation removal, and eventually increasing accuracy via modifying most important parameters.
